<P CLASS="msonormal"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Dear
Sir/Madam,</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="msonormal"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>I
would like to apply for the data scientist/engineer position at
SEOmoz. I am extremely impressed by SEOmoz's TAGFEE tenet and
actually “walk the talk”, in particular when it comes to
“Transparent and Authentic”. I am very excited about this
opportunity not just because I have the necessary research,
engineering and startups experience to contribute to SEOmoz, but more
importantly I really like the TAGFEE tenet.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="msolistparagraphcxspfirst" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>I
have 10 years of academic research experience, not counting graduate
school, in machine learning and data mining. I published extensively
in machine learning (see <A HREF="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/pers/hd/k/Kwek:Stephen.html">DBLP</A>)
and applied data mining in cancer genomics (see <A HREF="http://www.biomedexperts.com/Profile.bme/762903/Stephen_Kwek">biomedexperts.com</A>),
served in various conference committees and review journal papers,
and was in the editorial board of Intelligent Data Analysis. Further,
I managed a NSF- and NIH- funded research lab that graduated several
Ph.D. and M.S students who went on to have successful careers in
bioinformatics and data analytic areas.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="msolistparagraphcxspmiddle" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>I
spent 4 years in Microsoft Bing Search (formerly Live Search)
division as a senior software engineer. My jobs involved analyzing
enormous amount of search/ads data, dynamic ranking of the “10 blue
links”, ad-targeting based on user ad click behavior, trade-off
between ad placement and search results. After Microsoft, I worked
for a couple of startups as senior scientists on developing a generic
data science platform for recommendation system and game analytic
domains, apply natural language processing to medical coding of
electronic medical records.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="msolistparagraphcxspmiddle" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>You
can find a copy of my resume at <A HREF="resume">this link</A>. To
demonstrate that I have the coding skill for this job, I have also
completed several programming assignments that cover a wide range of
algorithm design topics. The sample code with some unittest can be
found <A HREF="code">here</A>.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="msolistparagraphcxspmiddle" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>I
have a deep knowledge in machine learning, engineering experience in
building large systems (Bing) and understand the issues faced by
startups. I appreciate your taking the time to review my credentials
and experience. </FONT></FONT>
