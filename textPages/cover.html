<P CLASS="msonormal">Dear Sir/Madam,</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">I would like to apply for the data scientist
position at SEOmoz. I am very excited about this opportunity because
I have the necessary research, engineering and startups experience
for this role.</P>
<P CLASS="msolistparagraphcxspfirst" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">I
have 10 years of academic research experience, not counting graduate
school, in machine learning and data mining. I published extensively
in machine learning (see <A HREF="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/pers/hd/k/Kwek:Stephen.html">DBLP</A>)
and applied to cancer genomics (see <A HREF="http://www.biomedexperts.com/Profile.bme/762903/Stephen_Kwek">biomedexperts.com</A>),
served in various conference committees and review journal papers,
and was in the editorial board of Intelligent Data Analysis. Further,
I managed a NSF- and NIH- funded research lab that graduated several
Ph.D. and M.S students who went on to have successful careers in
bioinformatics and data analytic areas.</P>
<P CLASS="msolistparagraphcxspmiddle" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="msolistparagraphcxspmiddle" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">I
spent 4 years in Microsoft Bing Search (formerly Live Search)
division as a senior software engineer. My jobs involved analyzing
enormous amount of search/ads data, dynamic ranking of the Â’10
blue linksÂ’, ad-targeting based on user ad click behavior,
trade-off between ad placement and search results.Â&nbsp; After
Microsoft, I worked for a couple of startups as senior scientists on
developing a generic data science platform for recommendation system
and game analytic domains, apply natural language processing to
medical coding of electronic medical records and fraud detection.</P>
<P CLASS="msolistparagraphcxspmiddle" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="msolistparagraphcxspmiddle" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">I
have a deep knowledge in machine learning, engineering experience in
building large systems (Bing) and understand the issues faced by
startups. I appreciate your taking the time to review my credentials
and experience. 
</P>
<P CLASS="msolistparagraphcxspmiddle" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="msolistparagraphcxspmiddle" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Sincerely,</P>
<P CLASS="msolistparagraphcxspmiddle" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="msolistparagraphcxsplast">Stephen Kwek, Ph.D.</P>
