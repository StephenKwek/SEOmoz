This web service is written using Python and web.py version 0.34 (see requirements.txt). The server code is in server.py.

The app has been deployed to Heroku and can be accessed via http://evening-journey-4913.herokuapp.com/ .From the homepage, you can access the resume and code sample page by following the links.
A simple monitor has also been implemented to show access frequency of each page, which can be access through the API monitor.

The code can be downloaded from github -- https://github.com/StephenKwek/SEOmoz
To run it locally, you need to:
1. Make sure that web.py v0.34 is installed.
2. Simply do "python server.py ${PortNumber}".
3. Enter 0.0.0.0:${PortNumber}


FILE ORGANIZATION:
The root directory contains three files:
    server.py : the simple server python code.
    server_unittest.py: unittest for server.py
    requirement.txt : consists of just a single line "web.py==0.34" telling Heroku to use web.py version 0.34.
    Procfile: instruction for Heruko to run "Python server.py ${PortNumber}".
   
The pages and sample C++ source codes are organized into 4 directories:
1. textPages: it contains the following four pages:
    cover.html : The cover letter for my SEOmoz job application.
    resume.html : My resume
    code.html : This is a list of coding problems and links to the sample solution. It has a total of 10 topics.
    index.html : This is the index pointing to different pages.

2. code: The original C/C++ sample codes are here. They are not used by the app server.
3. codePages: These are the html version of the sample codes in the directory code. They are the ones being served.
4. monitor: contains monitor.html which runs a python web.py template that displays the frequency of access for each page.
