This is written using Python and web.py version 0.34 (see requirements.txt). The server code is in server.py and is quite short and straightfoward. 

The app has been deployed to Heroku and can be accessed at http://evening-journey-4913.herokuapp.com/
To run it locally, you need to:
1. Make sure that web.py is installed. 
2. simply do "python server.py ${PortNumber}". 

FILE ORGANIZATION:
The root directory contains three files:
	server.py : the simple server python code. 
	server_unittest.py: unittest for server.py
	requirement.txt : consists of just a single line "web.py==0.34" telling Heroku to use web.py version 0.34.
	Procfile: instruct Heruk
	
There are pages and source sample C++ codes are organized into 3 directories:
1. textPages: it contains the following four pages:
	cover.html : The cover letter for my SEOmoz job application. 
	resume.html : My resume
	code.html : This is a list of coding problems and links to the sample solution. It has a total of 10 topics.
	index.html : This is the index pointing to different pages. 

2. code: The original C/C++ sample codes are here. They are not use by the app server. 
3. codePages: These are the html version of the sample codes in the directory code. They are the one being served.
